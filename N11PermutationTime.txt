This is the amount of time it took a 900 MHz AMD Athlon XP to calculate all the permutations of 11 variables for an 8 equation sudoku puzzle. Because of a
mistake in the formuation of the equations a solution was never found. 

Solving the equations for all possible combinations took a little under 8 hours
of computing time. 

This was done overnight on 5/20/2014.
